This repository showcases some of the projects I worked on for learning purposes.

## CTR0665 Notebook Ideas
CTR0665 is a cinema and audiovisual course I took during college. As part of the course, I was required to produce four short films and create a notebook documenting the ideas and creative processes for each film in any chosen format. I decided to design a simple HTML page as my notebook. This project became my first website and marked the beginning of my journey into learning HTML and CSS basics.

### TicTacDeco
This project is a simple tic-tac-toe game built with React. It was part of an assignment during an internship training program where I started learning React.
